I hear voices inside the walls
They whisper mostly 
sometimes a wave of voices fill the room
just quiet chatter,
indecipherable
I try but I don't know what they're saying
Tonight as I lie in bed with covers pulled high under my chin
I hear them
Whispers at first
Can barely hear them
I close my eyes
Which is terrifying but I do it
I need to sleep so badly but
They're getting louder
I can't ignore it
It's too quiet
in here

there's a fan at the end of my bed
I turn it on high
It's drowning out the voices
finally

a while goes by
I am drifting to sleep
It's been so long since I could sleep

there's the hum of the fan
but there's another hum
far and distant, faded
What is that? 
maybe I'm dreaming

it gets louder
louder
the 
fan
is overpowered 

THE VOICES SCREAM

suddenly, my heart halts
I can't breathe
the sheets veil my face
I do not want to see
I do not want to hear
I open my eyes

the screaming ceases 

the room is a void 
I hear nothing
it's dark
it's 
cold

a shadow is standing beside the bed
it's arms hang loosely 
motionless 
I hold my breath
I hear the hum
I think
It's too faint

another shadow
is leaning over me
it's arms are reaching 
for my sheet

I am crying
and I cannot breathe 
the humming grows louder
the sheet is yanked away

my eyes squint shut
I do not want to see
but I hear
so
loud
the humming is hurting my ears
I want to raise my hands to block my
ears
I can not move and I panic 



I open my eyes 


THE VOICES SCREAM

yet this time, I can see them
their mouths hang open wide 
like a snake about to consume
it's prey

I want to scream
and maybe I am
but I cannot tell

they screech
and roar
so loud

I cannot take it 
any longer

I close my eyes 
shut tight

as I feel the screams envelope me
screaming with a breathless voice

I am 





no longer
